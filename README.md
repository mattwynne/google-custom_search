# Google Custom Search

This gem gives you a Ruby interface onto Google's Custom Search APIs.

There are two APIs, an old XML one and a new JSON one. At the time of writing, the JSON one is not 
stable, so this gem aims to act as an adapter layer allowing you to call either service with the same
code.
